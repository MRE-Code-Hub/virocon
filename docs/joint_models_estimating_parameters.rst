The module GlobalHierarchicalModel implements functionality to fit a model structure to measured environmental data. In
other words, it can be used to estimate the parameter values of a joint distribution. To fit a model structure to a
dataset, we need to carry out the following steps:

1.	Define parametric functions
2.	Define univariate parametric distributions
3.	Define the dependence structure (model)
